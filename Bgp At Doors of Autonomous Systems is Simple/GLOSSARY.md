## BGP

BGP is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the internet.

## EVPN

EVPN is a Layer 2 virtual private network (VPN) technology that utilizes Ethernet and MAC address learning to create virtual networks over an IP/MPLS infrastructure.

## BGP EVPN

BGP EVPN is a network technology used in data centers to create scalable overlay networks.

## VXLAN

Virtual Extensible LAN is a network virtualization technology that extends Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 infrastructure.

## MPLS

Multiprotocol Label Switching is a routing technique that forwards data packets based on labels rather than traditional IP addresses.

## MAC addresses

Media Access Control addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface controllers.

## RR

Route Reflection simplifies the management and distribution of routing information in BGP networks.

## VTEP

VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint is a component thats acts as the entry and exit point for VXLAN traffic, encapsulating and decapsulating Ethernet frames into IP packets.

## OSPF

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a dynamic routing protocol to determine the most efficient path for data packets to reach their destination.

## VNI

Virtual Network Identifier is a unique identifier.
